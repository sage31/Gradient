## About
Gradient is a social networking website designed for college students. Rather than matching students together, Gradient allows students to enter names of their crushes, 
and lets them know if they are crushing on them as well. When this happens, the person will show up in their "matches" section. Otherwise, the student
will simply show up in the other person's "secret admirer's" tab. Students may have up to ten crushes, which they can remove at any time. The app requires a valid
school email address.
